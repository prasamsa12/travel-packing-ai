technologies used
Prisma: Utilized to facilitate seamless interaction with the database, Prisma acts as an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool, simplifying database queries and providing type safety for more efficient data management.

PostgreSQL: Chosen as the database solution for its reliability, scalability, and support for complex queries, PostgreSQL serves as the backbone for storing and retrieving application data.

OpenAI API: Integrated to generate customized travel itineraries, the OpenAI API helps craft personalized travel plans by leveraging advanced AI models to tailor suggestions based on user preferences.

OpenWeather API: Employed to retrieve accurate weather information, the OpenWeather API allows the app to adapt the travel plans and packing lists according to current weather conditions.

SwiperJS: Used to create engaging, interactive image sliders, SwiperJS enhances the user experience by displaying beautiful, swipeable images that showcase destinations in a dynamic and visually appealing way.
Next.js: Selected for its capability to enable the development of a full-stack application with React, Next.js enhances performance through features like server-side rendering and static generation, making it ideal for building scalable and dynamic web apps.

TypeScript: Implemented to elevate code quality by incorporating static types, TypeScript helps catch errors early in the development process, leading to more reliable and maintainable code.

TanStack Query: Utilized to manage the applicationâ€™s server state, TanStack Query simplifies handling database and API requests while efficiently caching data, improving performance by reducing unnecessary data fetching.

Context API: Integrated to provide a centralized state management solution, the Context API makes it possible to share state across the application without the need to pass props down through multiple layers of components.
